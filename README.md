# Exercise 1


This exercise was designed by our teacher [Francisco Pina-Martins](https://github.com/StuntsPT) to introduce us 
to the subject Perspectives in Bioinformatics.

The first class gave us a glimpse of what we can expect throughout this bachelor and throughout our careers,
while embracing this field of work.

For this exercised we were asked to write a 21 base pair sequence of DNA (or RNA) that would contain 
4 ambiguities.

Then we needed to re-write 3 possible unambiguous sequences based on the previous one.

After writing the first ambiguous sequence and the 3 possible unambiguous sequence we were asked to pick 1 ambiguous
sequence and to write its reversed sequence, its complement sequence, its reversed-complement and the amino-acid chain
it would produce.
